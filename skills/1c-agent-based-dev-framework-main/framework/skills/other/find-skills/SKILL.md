# Find Skills

Discover and install skills from the open agent skills ecosystem (`npx skills`).

## When to Use

User asks "how do I do X", "find a skill for X", "can you do X", wants to extend capabilities, or mentions a specific domain (design, testing, deployment, etc.).

## Key Commands

```bash
npx skills find [query]        # Search by keyword
npx skills add <owner/repo@skill> -g -y  # Install globally
npx skills check               # Check for updates
npx skills update              # Update all
```

## Workflow

1. **Identify** domain + specific task from user's request
2. **Search:** `npx skills find <relevant keywords>` (use specific terms: "react testing" > "testing")
3. **Present** skill name, install command, and skills.sh link
4. **Install** if user agrees: `npx skills add <owner/repo@skill> -g -y`

If no skills found: offer to help directly, suggest `npx skills init` for custom skill.
